INTRODUCTION:

Simple Food Ordering System is based on the concept of ordering and serving food in a cafe. There’s no login system for this project.
Here, a user can order available food items, serve it and check total records. This project contains few features but the essentials 
ones.

Talking about Simple Food Ordering System, the user can easily order available foods. For this, the user has to enter his/her name, 
the total number of the item, item code number, and quantity. There’s no CRUD feature for food items. Each of the items has its own 
size and the user also has to select the size before ordering any item. After ordering an item, the system displays the total amount.
The selected food items also need to get served. The user can easily serve food after an order is made. The user can also check total
records of the cafe which displays the total number of order taken, and served.

REQUIREMENTS:

In this mini project, the system does not use or create any external files to store the data permanently. Simple Food Ordering System
is developed using C Programming Language and different variables, strings have been used for the development of it.This project 
provides the simplest system for ordering and serving food in a cafe. In order to run the project, you must have installed Dev C++ or 
Visual Studio on your PC.

To write this program we are going to need:

.   A way of representing the menu.
·   A way of representing the how many orders it will be taken by user.
·   A way to display the bill, how many items ordered, how many items served and all
·   A way for our instructions to serve the items.


Let's look at how a program works:
1. Based on reading a number it will calls a particular funtion. It will be explained as follows
2.For example when we run a program it displays the "welcome to cafe message"
3.next displays the list of options like
	3.1 menu
	3.2 order
	3.3 serve
	3.4 display
	3.5 exit
4.if you want to know the menu then click 1, you want to order click 2, you want to serve the order click 3,you want to display
the list of items that u taken then click 4 and you want to exit from the cafe website then click 5.
